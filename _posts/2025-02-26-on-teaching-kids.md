I’ve been thinking a lot about teaching kids. And right now, I’m actually teaching in several schools.

That is good, that is joyous! I really like this work. I see myself in it. I feel a calling to be a teacher—whatever that might mean.

A sad fact: at the moment, I don’t have many students. Because of this, I don’t earn enough to cover all my expenses. But the situation is improving step by step. Every new student is a blessing.

I also spoke with my boss at one of the schools, and I might take on some administrative work as well—such as evaluating other teachers’ skills. This is good. I want it. I want more work that aligns with my values.

Moreover, I come up with new projects almost every day! Today, I had the idea for a course on family memory for teenagers. In it, we would explore family history, conduct interviews with relatives, reflect on those conversations, and draw our own conclusions—perhaps even reconsider some life choices.

Another idea is a course on creating visual novels in Python. I actually want to make a visual novel myself, but I’ll need some comrades for the writing and artwork. It’s a really promising idea that needs development and technical testing. This could also be a course for teenagers, but I want to make it truly holistic—not just about programming, but also about storytelling, drawing, and world-building. Because of this, I can’t create the course alone.

## Konstantin Stanislavski’s An Actor’s Work
I recently started reading Konstantin Stanislavski’s An Actor’s Work. Oh, it’s directly related to teaching! First of all, it’s a manual in itself. And it’s both important and fascinating to analyze how exactly he presents complex and innovative ideas about acting.

In the book, Stanislavski introduces the distinction between "the art of experiencing" and "the art of representation" in acting.

Representation is just appearance—a superficial display of forms and gestures without real life behind the role. In this case, the actor simply repeats words and actions without true psychological engagement.
But the real art, according to Stanislavski, is experiencing. This is a true immersion in emotions—a holistic approach to playing a role. It involves conditions, imagination, artistic tasks, and inner motivation. When all of these elements are combined properly, the actor experiences real emotions and states of mind. And this is what creates a perfect performance. The body and soul act naturally, fully aligned with the role. As a result, the audience receives all the subtle meanings—or rather, those meanings are constructed within the audience.
This is very much the task of a teacher. You are not just a book. It’s not just about presenting information correctly. The real challenge is creating a special mood or attitude in the student—spreading the vibe, the love for the subject, the curiosity. At the same time, you must remain professional and share meaningful knowledge. This is very similar to the work of an actor, and Stanislavski offers valuable insights into how to "color" your performance in the classroom.

Of course, there’s a difference. As a teacher, you must find your own vibe, your own tone for the subject. Or, even better, you must create a new, improved one during your lesson. And this is crucial because lessons are seeds—they will continue to grow in the student’s mind for a lifetime. One day, they will understand all the details about their childhood teacher. And that realization should be warm, inspiring, unpretentious, and honest.

Lessons should plant seeds of hope—seeds of a better, shared future. And I hope this book will help me in some way.
