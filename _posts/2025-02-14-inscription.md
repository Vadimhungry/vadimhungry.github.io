For about two weeks or so, I’ve been playing Inscryption.
This is an indie game with a main focus on deck-building, like Magic: The Gathering and other games of this type.
But this one is special because the developers combine the purely mathematical fun of deck-building with quest and escape-room mechanics.

Why do I spend time on it anyway? It really delivers a powerful and deep atmosphere. It triggers suspense. I don’t really want to spoil anything, so I have to be vague.

It’s interesting. This perspective purifies my view—I can simply talk about emotion and art without diving into the details of the story.

So how does this game create suspense and deep engagement? It throws you directly into the middle of a bizarre, strange world. And this world is full of magic, mythology, and conspiracy theories.

Step by step, you start looking for clues. And you find yourself absorbed. The actual narrative is at least two-layered. We have the world of the game and the connected meta-narrative—a reflection of some guy on the game, his story of discovering it.

The in-game narrative is quite typical—kind of an ambiguous dark fantasy with forest creatures, necromancers, weird robots, and more. We cut through enemies, rebuild our deck, and refine our tactics.

At the same time, we have a side story of the player. From time to time, it breaks through. We get access to some materials, notably camera recordings.

These recordings are totally awesome. They create suspense. You believe them—especially because they are fragmentary and DIY-ish. We see some geek in his living room. With simple techniques, they evolve the story.

All of this is ambiguous as hell! Of course, you probably can’t understand anything. But on the other hand, if I explained it more clearly, my speech would be overloaded with spoilers.

Doesn’t matter. All of this leads me to a broader gaming question—or rather, a problem. This deck shuffling, delighting in fairy tales, and so on… How is it really connected to our everyday life?

Is it just simple escapism? I guess not, or at least not always. Games can reshape our perception and emotional patterns. Great titles definitely do that. But in what way? When is it meaningful, worth our time and practice? You’ll never truly know without gaming experience.

Oh yes, Inscryption. I feel like it’s about that kind of stuff. The vibe of weirdness. A reflection on how a purely rational mind can get lost in the world, trapped in dull phantasms. And yet, it still remains materially connected to reality—through common sense, contemporary tools like the internet, the very existence of society, and so on.
