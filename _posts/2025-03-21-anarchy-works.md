I just finished reading the book Anarchy Works. It's a compilation made up of excerpts from different books. All the material is obviously about anarchy in Russia.

The authors collected various examples of libertarian and anti-authoritarian communes and communities throughout Russian history.

Some of them, such as the communities of Tolstoy's followers or the Cossacks, are well known even to the general public. Some religious sects, however, are quite exotic and never mentioned in general history courses in schools and universities.

Yet the most impressive part of the book was the story about the commune May’s Morning. But it wasn’t really the lifestyle of those people that fascinated me. Their way of life was typical for socialist communes of that time.

What captivated me was the work of its founder, Adrian Toporov. He practiced critical literary reading with the poorest peasants—that is, with the commune’s community—and wrote an entire book about it. He transcribed the sessions of classical literature interpretation and criticism.

What’s really interesting is that all the criticism and discussions were carried out by uneducated people. Toporov mainly facilitated the discussions, but the community made its own decisions about books. They could choose to stop reading something for a particular reason, and all the participants developed a truly unique attitude and understanding of literary works. Over the years of this seminar, the peasants learned to distinguish different literary movements and styles. They developed genuinely interesting, independent perspectives on books, forming their own opinions and aesthetics. And still, it was their own aesthetics. They liberated a special village language—concrete, tangible, and poetic at the same time.

Now I want to read Toporov’s work, Peasants About Writers.
